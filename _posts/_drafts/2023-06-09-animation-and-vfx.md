# Animation

There is almost no traditional animation left. It is understandable, since it is a very expensive and labor-intensive process. [James Baxter](https://www.youtube.com/@jamesbaxter1236)

## Limited animation

The only way to make the process. Shots are repeated, drawings are reused.

- Ace Attorney: the original games achive so much with so little animation. [Great video on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV8sjRTiWC8&pp=ygUWYWNlIGF0dG9ybmV5IGFuaW1hdGlvbg%3D%3D)
- Bojack Horseman:
- Anime: shots where almost nothing is moving

(video de ter de 101 dalmatas)

## Digital animation techniques
- 2D
- 3D
  - Realistic: be careful not to fall into the Uncanney Valley
  - Cartoon:
  - Snappy: exagerated version
- Stop-motion: Isle of Dogs, Coraline, Kubo
- Cut-out
- Rotoscoping: drawing over a video
  - [Loving Vincent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGzKnyhYDQI&pp=ygUObG92aW5nIHZpbmNlbnQ%3D)
  - [<img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/HKCJJgs1p2Q/maxresdefault.jpg" width="50%">](https://youtu.be/HKCJJgs1p2Q)
- Interpolation and morphing
  - Born in the 80s, looks really weird
  - [La faim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CvzUZXD9_c&pp=ygUHbGEgZmFpbQ%3D%3D)
- Procedural animation

I want to highlight the short [The Windshield Wiper](https://www.thewindshieldwiper.com/), winner of the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film 2022. It is one of the most impressive pieces of animation I've seen in terms of style and lighting.

None of this are completely gone. All of them are used sometimes.
