This is the first post of my Digital Culture Notes series! Right now I am taking a really cool subject at college called "Digital Culture", where we study videogames, animation, digital art, social media, etc. We take all kinds of nerdy stuff and try to make it sound intelligen. I will be posting some notes I took in theory classes with links to . You can see and download the slides we used in class [here](../files/%F0%9F%8E%AE%20%F0%9F%91%BE%20%F0%9F%95%B9%EF%B8%8F%20Videojocs.pdf).

_Note: The interesting stuff is after "random stuff" because there are some -reallly- niche stuff. (the kind of stuff you learn at uni)._ #TODO: rewrite this better

# Really old games you can play today

Videogames were born in the 50s. Some of the first ones are:

Much later came **interactive text adventures**. In these, the player uses the keyboard to enter commands like "grab the rope" or "go west" and the computer goes describing what happens and how the story progresses. 

- [Colossal Cave Adventure](https://www.colossalcave3d.com/play-the-original-text-adventure/) (1976): first text adventure game.
- [Zork](http://textadventures.co.uk/games/play/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq): really popular and influential game where players navigate an undergroud world full of caves and river and battle monsters to get treasures. Sold over 800 000 copies for PC.
- [Mystery House](https://archive.org/details/Hi-Res_Adventure_1_Mystery_House_1980_On-Line_Systems) (1980): one of the first ones with graphics
- [King's Quest](https://playclassic.games/games/adventure-dos-games-online/play-kings-quest-quest-crown-online/play/) (1984): same author as Mystery House, Roberta Williams. First ever 3rd person graphic adventure.
