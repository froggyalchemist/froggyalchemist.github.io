# my favorite internet things

hey there! for my first post on this blog, i wrote a version of 'My Favorite Things' form *The Sound of The Music*. i suggest you listen to [the original song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33o32C0ogVM) first to get a feel for the rhythm.

>:notes: youtube tutorials and long video essays
awesome fan wikis and chill minecraft let's plays
gamers and furries and bronies and weebs
these are my favorite internet things
>
>history podcasts and open source projects 
deep web links that go to hidden drug markets
suspicious sites to watch movies for free
these are my favorite internet things
>
>reddit shitposting and funny webcomics
that weird video where mario fucks sonic
people that post photos to wikifeet
these are my favorite internet things :notes:
